				I am from Peru. My city is Iquitos where the
				<strong>Amazon</strong> river and the <strong>Nanay</strong> river come
				together. I came to the USA in 2013, and I got my first job as a Front
				Clerk at Publix in 2014.

			<p id="mySecondParagraph">
				I have been looking for a job in technology for 3 years, but my
				interviewers always told me that I have a gap without working in my
				career. Then I realized that I needed to update my programming skills,
				so I took some online courses on EDX, SoloLearn, Coursera, HackerRank,
				DataCamp. While I was taking my online courses, I took some English
				classes to improve my communication skills at SP College.
